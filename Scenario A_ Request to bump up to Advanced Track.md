Dear John,

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I wanted to personally connect with you regarding your request to join the Advanced Track of our Web Development program. Your enthusiasm for challenging yourself and making the most of your time here at CodePath is truly commendable.

We are genuinely grateful for your interest in the Advanced Track, and we recognize the exceptional academic journey you've had at MIT. Your dedication to education is evident, and it's something we highly value. However, after carefully considering your pre-work score and reviewing both the syllabi for the Intermediate and Advanced tracks, we've concluded that maintaining your placement in the Intermediate Track is the most suitable path.

Please understand that our decision is not a reflection of any doubts about your abilities or potential. Rather, it stems from a thoughtful evaluation of your current skill level and the curriculum's complexity. Our primary aim is to provide every student with an environment where they can thrive and grow. This often entails placing individuals in tracks that align closely with their current proficiency.

The Advanced Track involves more intricate concepts that presuppose a certain foundation in the prerequisites outlined in the syllabus. Placing students in tracks that match their present capabilities ensures a smoother progression through the material, resulting in a more fulfilling learning experience.

I urge you to continue your journey within the Intermediate Track, which will lay down a strong foundation in web development. This foundation will undoubtedly serve as a solid platform for your future endeavors. Be assured that we stand by your side, ready to offer support and resources to assist you throughout this process.

Please recognize that our decision is driven by our earnest desire to see you flourish and succeed. If you have any inquiries or seek further clarification on our decision, please don't hesitate to email us at admissions@codepath.org. We're here to help you and ensure that your time in the program is meaningful and rewarding.

Thank you for your understanding. I'm genuinely excited to witness your growth and progress in the weeks to come.

All the best,
