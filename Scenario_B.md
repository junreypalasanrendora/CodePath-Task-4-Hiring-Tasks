Hi Jane,

Thanks so much for reaching out and sharing your feelings about the eligibility requirements. We're truly impressed with the effort you invested in the Flix app and completing our application.

We totally get how disappointing this must be for you, especially after all your hard work. Your enthusiasm for learning really stands out, and we admire your dedication.

At the moment, our courses are designed for students in partner US universities due to our current resources and collaborations. We understand if this wasn't clear from the start, and we apologize for any confusion.

While we can't make exceptions right now, we genuinely hope you'll keep exploring your learning journey. We'll keep you posted if we expand to other countries. Your interest means a lot to us.

Thank you again for considering our program and sharing your thoughts. If you have more questions or need assistance, please donâ€™t hesitate to email us at admissions@codepath.org.

All the best,

CodePath.org <br> 
Office of Admissions
